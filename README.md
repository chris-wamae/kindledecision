# Kindledecision
Kindledecision is a web application that facilitates group decision making in a way that ensures everyone is on the same page. 

## How does it work
In summary, the application works by users creating topics called queries and adding other users to take part in them. 

These topics have choices that other users can select. All the users that were added to the query can view the progress of the selections and the final results at the end.

### User accounts

### Queries
It does this through the use of queries. Queries are questions/topics created by users when they are looking for anwsers/opinions from specific people. After creating the query, a user then adds choices to it for which serve as the available anwsers to it. Finally, the creator of the query adds other app users to the query (called participants) who will be able to select a choice in the query.
