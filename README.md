# Kindledecision
Kindledecision is a web application that aims to easen the process of making group decisions.

## How does it work

### User accounts

### Queries
It does this through the use of queries. Queries are questions/topics created by users when they are looking for anwsers/opinions from specific people. After creating the query, a user then adds choices to it for which serve as the available anwsers to it. Finally, the creator of the query adds other app users to the query (called participants) who will be able to select a choice in the query.
